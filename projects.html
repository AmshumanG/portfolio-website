        <H1>Identification of Association of Parameters with More Impact Using Deep Learning</H1>
        <p> Developed a deep learning model that improved early dementia diagnosis with 87% accuracy, aiding medical professionals in decision-making.</p>
        <p>Used CNNs for MRI scans and LSTMs for analyzing medical records over time.</p>
        <p>Processed data to identify patterns related to dementia.</p>
        <p>Trained and tested the model to ensure accurate predictions. </p>
        <p>Helped improve early diagnosis by providing useful insights for doctors. </p>
        <H1>Real-Time Motion Detection with Alert System</H1>
        <p>•  Developed a real-time motion detection system: Utilized Python, OpenCV, and Pygame to capture and process live video frames from a webcam.</p>
        <p>•  Implemented advanced image processing techniques: Applied frame differencing, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding, and contour </p>
        <p>   to accurately identify motion.</p>
        <p>•  Integrated alert mechanism: Triggered sound alerts and highlighted motion areas in the video feed when significant movement was detected.  </p>
        <p>•  Ensured user-friendly operation: Created an intuitive interface with real-time feedback and easy termination using the 'ESC' key.  </p>
        <H1>WhatsApp chatbot</H1>
        <p>• Developed WhatsApp chatbot using Python to send automated text messages in a 24-hour format.   </p>
       
        <p>• Utilized the pywhatkit and datetime packages for efficient time management and message formatting</p>
        <p>• Implemented features to enhance user interaction and automate routine tasks.   </p>
